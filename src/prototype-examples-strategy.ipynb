Incentives can be financial, such as tax credits for protecting natural resources, or procedural, such as height or floor area bonuses for designs that are more resilient to hazards.  Incorporate measures into hazard mitigation and other plans to rebuild in stronger and more resilient ways should a disaster occur. Identifying and assessing hazards as they relate to infrastructure, capital improvement, and/or transportation improvement plans lets a community prioritize projects and pursue funding from state and federal sources. Communities that upgrade local plans are also in a better position to request postdisaster assistance when the next disaster occurs because they already have projects identified and know where and how to direct rebuilding. Communities can align their capital improvement plans with hazard mitigation plans to identify infrastructure and critical facility vulnerabilities or deficiencies and plan for needed improvements. They can inventory infrastructure and facilities and document how well the infrastructure can handle known and projected hazards (e.g., culvert capacity relative to 500- year stormwater flows). Incorporating hazard information into long-term capital improvement planning can help prioritize projects such as upgrading roads and utilities in safer development areas; improving stormwater infrastructure; restoring streams and habitat; '"

Zoning incentives can allow a greater height,  density, or intensity of development if a developer uses  nature-based approaches. One common zoning incentive  is an increased floor-to-area ratio (FAR), which regulates  the density of development on a site. The City of Portland,  Oregon offers increased FAR as an incentive for installing  green roofs. Communities can also exempt green roofs  or pervious pavements from any regulations that apply to  impervious cover.  More incentives for adopting nature-based solutions  approaches can be used in the development application  and review period. These include discounted application  fees and discounted or waived maintenance bonding  requirements. The City of Chicago, Illinois waives permit fees  for developments that meet specific nature-based solutions  thresholds. For redevelopment, communities can also give a  one-time tax credit for using nature-based approaches that  benefit the public.  More communities are moving from strict standards to  more flexible instruments that include incentives. They are  encouraging developers to use nature-based solutions through  unified development ordinances.

A number of the measures discussed in this  guide can be implemented through zoning.  Zoning can be used to regulate parcel use, density of  development, building dimensions, setbacks, impervious  surfaces, type of construction (e.g., easily movable),  shore protection structures, landscaping, etc. It can also  be used to regulate where development can and cannot  take place, making it an invaluable tool in efforts to  protect natural resources and environmentally sensitive  areas and guide development away from hazard-prone  areas. Permissible uses and standards vary by zoning  district. Types of districts include general use districts;  overlay districts, where provisions in addition to those  on the underlying districts apply; and special use  districts, in which all uses require permits.  Floodplain zoning is an example of a zoning application  that, if thoughtfully drafted, can provide multiple  benefits. In addition to protecting life and property,  benefits of floodplain zoning can include resource  conservation, open space preservation, public access,  and water-quality protection. Floodplain regulations that  just meet the minimum requirements of the National  Flood Insurance Program are more focused on how to  build safely in the floodplain and may not provide the  additional benefits']"
